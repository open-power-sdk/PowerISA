# PowerISA
JSON-formatted representation of the OpenPOWER Foundation Instruction Set Architecture

This data is created by directly parsing the LaTeX sources of the OpenPOWER
Foundation Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) document, the DocBook sources
of the Power Vector Intrinsic Programming Reference (PVIPR), and
programmatically generated list of Power ISA extended mnemonics.

This work is still under development, and the formats may change without
notice.  Feedback is welcome by opening issues at
https://github.com/open-power-sdk/PowerISA/issues.
